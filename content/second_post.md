#Radiation Safety
##SI 30 of 2019

Statutory instrument 30 (SI 30) of 2019 is a radiation safety legislation addressing regulations for workers and members of the public. The regulating authority is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA conduct **inspections** with and without warning. They are responsible for **licensing** and **registration** for various practices. Registration is required for practices with low radiation doses in Medical/Dental/Industrial/Security areas. Examples include general radiography, dental radiography, security screening and product inspection. Licensing is required for practices with high doses in Medical/Dental areas. Examples include LINACs, CT, PET, nuclear medicine, brachytherapy and intra-oral unit dental radiography.


Under SI30, there are two areas of interest in a practice. **Supervised** areas are those with dose rates >1mSv/10months like the lobby area of a LINAC room. These areas are kept under revision. **Controlled** areas are those with dose rates >6mSv/y like the LINAC bunker. It is important to follow the radiation safety procedures in those areas.


SI30 set out yearly effective **dose limitations** for workers and public. Public dose limits are 1mSv total, 15mSv for eyes and 50mSv for skin/extremeties. Workers dose limits are 20mSv total, 20mSv for eyes and 500mSv skin/extremeties. **Category A** workers are those receiving doses of >1mSv. **Category B** workers are those receiving doses of >6mSv. Dose limitations don't apply for personal medical exposures and in the case of knowing/willing patient comfort.


**Dose Monitoring** should be performed using an **approved dosimetry service**. In cases of accidental/emergency exposures assessment of the body dose distribution should take place. Staff could be asked to wear a **badge or a ring dosimeters** and report any incidents involving those. Hand-held monitors can be used for **workplace surveys** and in cases of contaminations. Any **incident** should be investigated and **reported** to the RPA, taking inco account doses, causes, and corrective actions. 


Appropriate **risk assessment** should be performed by the undertanking in order to meet **radiation protection** requirements. This involves **annual review** of licensed terms and conditions, **badging** requirements, **pregnant** workers, and **radionuclide therapy**. Radiation safety procedures are most important for **emergency response plans** and for **specialised training** for those working with HDR, in a theatre or in nuclear medicine department.


**Duties** of workers in terms of radiation protection include **not to knowingly expose** themselves or others, to use Personal Protective Equipment (**PPE**) or **dosemeters**, **report** any defects/incidents/unusual occurance with potential breach of dose limits.


##SI 256 of 2018
Statutory instrument 256 (SI 30) of 2018 is a radiation safety legislation addressing protection of patients. The regulating authority is the Health Information and Quality Authority (**HIQA**).
